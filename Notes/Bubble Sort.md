## Bubble Sort

Comparison Sorting Method: Compares adjacent elements and swaps positions putting the largest element at the end with every pass.

<i>E.g.</i>

arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]

<b>Pass 1</b>

3<>1, 5, 4, 2 (3>1) -> Swap

1, 3, 5<>4, 2 (5>4) -> Swap

1, 3, 4, 5<>2 (5>2) -> Swap

1, 3, 4, 2, 5 -> Largest element at the end



These steps will continue until the array is sorted.
